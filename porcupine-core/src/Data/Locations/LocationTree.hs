-- | A very simple virtual filesystem. Defines a hierarchy of virtual locations,
-- and some rules for how to store and read files. Each type of pipeline
-- (solving, exploration) will need its 'LocationTree', that can be obtained by
-- composing the 'LocationTree's of the tasks it contains.
--
-- In a project using pipeline-tools, the project's code will only use virtual
-- paths, and it won't know what actual physical location is behind that path.
--
-- We could use a DocRecord to represent a LocationTree. Maybe we'll refactor it
-- to use DocRecords in the future, but for now it was simpler to use a simple
-- tree of maps.
