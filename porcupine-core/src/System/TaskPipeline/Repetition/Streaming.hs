-- * Type aliases for tasks over streams

-- | An PTask mapping a action over a Stream, transforming @a@'s into
-- @b@'s. Each element in the stream should be associated to an identifier.
type STask m a b r =
  PTask m
        (Stream (Of a) m r)
        (Stream (Of b) m r)

-- | An 'PTask' that consumes an Input Stream and just returns its result.
type ISTask m a r =
  PTask m
        (Stream (Of a) m r)
        r

-- | An 'PTask' that emits an Output Stream.
type OSTask m a b =
  PTask m
        a
        (Stream (Of b) m ())

-- * Running tasks over streams

-- | Turns a task into something that will be repeated once per each item in its
-- input. This is done by transforming VirtualFile accessed by the tasks to add
-- a 'RepetitionKey' to it, indicating that its final file name should be
-- modified by adding an identifier to it just before reading it or writing it.
-- So each loop actually accesses different locations in the end.
--
-- Calls to 'mappingOverStream' can be nested, this way the underlying VirtualFiles
-- will have one 'RepetitionKey' per loop (from outermost loop to innermost).
